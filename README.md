This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through the influential and thought-provoking book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs." In this repository, I will be sharing my code solutions and detailed explanations of my thought processes as I work through the exercises and concepts presented in the book.
This is the first book of the recommended study list on https://teachyourselfcs.com/, i'm a computer engineer major and former bootcamp student at https://www.betrybe.com/, looking to fill my knowledge gaps with the books and lectures.

Why SICP?
"SICP" is not just a book; it's a timeless masterpiece that has shaped the way countless programmers think about computation and programming. Through its pages, you will explore fundamental concepts in computer science and gain a deep understanding of how to approach complex problems with elegant and efficient solutions. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, SICP offers valuable insights that can benefit everyone.

What to Expect
In this repository:

Code Solutions: I will provide code solutions to the exercises presented in SICP. These solutions will be crafted to demonstrate the principles and techniques covered in the book, and try to convey my thought process behind them, by no means it will anywhere near perfect, please pardon me for eventual mistakes i'll make and feel free to send me tips.

Explanatory Notes: Each code solution will be accompanied by detailed explanations. I will break down the thought processes, algorithms, and design decisions behind each piece of code to ensure clarity and comprehension.

Additional Resources: Throughout my SICP journey, I will also share useful resources, links, and supplementary materials that can enhance your understanding of the topics discussed in the book.
